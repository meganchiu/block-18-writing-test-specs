# Block 18 Workshop - Writing Test Specifications

## Unit Tests
1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

## Functional Tests
1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
